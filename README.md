# Multithreading-sandbox
Stack: Java 8, Eclipse IDE, IntelliJ Idea, Git, Collections framework, Lambda API, Concurrency, Maven, Gradle

  This repository is devoted to two things:
1. Firstly I am testing different approaches on how to set up architecture of my self designed 
algorithm of instantaneous nuclear reactor active core state analyze.
2. Learning Java multithreading, such as:
>Creating thread with Thread class;
> 
> Discovered thread lifecycle methods;
>
> Learned a lot about synchronization and use of synchronized keyword and synchronized codeblocks;
> 
> Learned how to implement Runnable task with lambda API;
> 
> Volatile keyword and Happens-Before principle;
> 
> Atomic numbers and operations with them;
> 
> Cases which may occur a DeadLock;
> 
> Use of java.lang.Object methods such as wait()/notify();
> 
> Use of ReentrantLock, and it's difference compare to synchronized blocks and methods;
>
> How to use Callable interface and obtainment results of an asynchronous operations with Future interface. 
> 
> Use of Conditions with ReentrantLock;
